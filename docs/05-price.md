## Pricing Options and Plans

There are four different plans with different price options available:

### 1. Limited: Free

The limited version is full featured, but there is a limit to the number of subscribers. This limit is 10,000, and after the limit is reached, the events app stops recording new subscribers to the database. Also the sender app will only send out 10,000 push notifications each time.

### 2. Monthly: $29 per month

This version has no limits, but after the plan expires, the application will automatically revert to the Limited mode plan.

### 3. Annual: $299 per year

This version has no limits, but after the plan expires, the application will automatically revert to the Limited mode plan.
